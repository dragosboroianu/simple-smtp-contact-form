# simple-smtp-contact-form
Most of the websites have a contact form. However, many of them are sending the contact message using the mail(); function, and that is not reliable anymore. Sending the messages using SMTP should be mandatory nowadays for any form that sends email messages.  I'm in the web hosting industry for 10+ years, and I'm surprised to see "developers" that don't know how to swithc from mail(); to SMTP.   So, the purpose is to offer them a little help and in this matter with this SMTP contact form example.
