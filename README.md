# Simple PHP/HTML contact form that sends messages using SMTP.
Most of the websites have a contact form. However, many of them are sending the contact message using the mail(); function, and that is not reliable anymore. Sending the messages using SMTP should be mandatory nowadays for any form that sends email messages - only this way you can make sure the messages will not be rejected and you will receive them in your Inbox.  

I'm in the web hosting industry for 10+ years, and I'm surprised to see "developers" that don't know how to swithc from mail(); to SMTP.   So, the purpose is to offer them a little help and in this matter with this SMTP contact form example.
